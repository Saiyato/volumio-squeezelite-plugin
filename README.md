# volumio-squeezelite-plugin
Volumio plugin to install and configure a Squeezelite client

Not much to say about it, it's pretty straight forward.

It starts with default values:

-o default
-n Volumio
-a 80:4::
-s 127.0.0.1

I tried to make it work on a miniDSP SHD with the NEO3 board.
This fork isn't tested properly yet.

I'm running a version on my miniDSP SHD.
I'll try to confirm if it works asap.
Maybe Saiyato can transfer the changes into his master. (I'm new to gitHub)
